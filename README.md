Introduction
Diabetes is noxious diseases in the world. Diabetes caused because of obesity or high blood glucose level
World Health Organization around 422 million individuals experiencing diabetes particularly from low or inactive pay nations. What's more, this could be expanded to 490 billion up to the extended period of 2030. Anyway commonness of diabetes is found among different Countries like Canada, China, and India and so on. Populace of India is currently in excess of 100 million so the genuine number of diabetics in India is 40 million. Diabetes is significant reason for death on the planet.
Abstract
Diabetes is a disease caused due to high glucose level in a human body. Diabetes ought not be overlooked in the event that it is untreated, Diabetes might cause a few significant issues in an individual like: heart related issues, kidney issue, circulatory strain, eye harm and it can likewise influences different organs of human body.


Diabetes can be controlled on the off chance that it is anticipated before. To accomplish this objective this task work we will do early expectation of Diabetes in a human body or a patient for a higher exactness through applying, Various Machine Learning Techniques. AI procedures Provide improved outcome for expectation by con-structing models from datasets gathered from patients
In this work we will utilize Machine Learning Classification and outfit procedures on a dataset to foresee diabetes.
The Project work gives the exact or higher precision model shows that the model is capa-ble of foreseeing diabetes really

Problem statement
Doctors rely on common knowledge for treatment. When common knowledge is lacking, studies are summarized after some number of cases have been studied. But this process takes time, whereas if machine learning is used, the patterns can be identified earlier
Data set
Kaggle-pima Indians Diabetes Database

Justification for the proposed problem
Motivation and Need

The motivation was to experiment with end to end machine learning project and get some idea about deployment platform like Google-COLAB. Using machine learning we have built a predictive model that can predict whether the patient is diabetes positive or not.". This is also sort of fun to work on a project like this which could be beneficial for the society.
   
Software/Tools Requirements
Google COLAB( Python) – Machine Learning
VS Code – Front End

Source of data set
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database?select=diabetes.csv 

Justification :
The dataset consists of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, Blood Pressure, Pregnancies, Skin thickness and so on..
CONCLUSION

After using all these patient records dataset, we are able to build a machine learning model (random forest) to accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not along with that we were able to draw some insights from the data via data analysis and visualization.
